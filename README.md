# 🎓 Jeremy Rogers (hullucid)
**`Current CS Student (Aspiring Developer)`** 

📌I am a sophmore undergrad student majoring in **Computer Science**, climbing the ladder of the programming world and all it has to offer. Along the way, what would be most **desirable** is gradually developing a mastery of the skill and getting a hold of every theory and concept that I can grasp. There is a very long journey ahead, but I am hunting for opportunity, connections, and a **community of like-minded people**. Programming has opened yet another path that sparks the **essence of digital creativity** for me, and I would like to see what may become of myself and others innovation.
